# BroPilot

BroPilot is a Visual Studio extension that brings the power of local Large Language Models (LLMs) directly into your development workflow. Unlike cloud-based AI assistants, BroPilot enables intelligent code assistance—such as code completions, explanations, and refactoring suggestions—without sending your code or context to external servers. This ensures privacy, low latency, and full control over your development environment.

## Problem Statement

Modern software development increasingly relies on AI-powered code assistants to boost productivity, improve code quality, and reduce repetitive tasks. However, most existing solutions require sending sensitive code to third-party cloud services, raising concerns about privacy, data security, and compliance. Additionally, reliance on external APIs can introduce latency, cost, and dependency risks.

**BroPilot addresses these challenges by:**
- Allowing developers to leverage advanced code assistance features powered by local LLMs.
- Ensuring that all code and context remain on the developer's machine.
- Providing a seamless, integrated experience within Visual Studio.

## Performance

BroPilot is engineered for high performance and a smooth user experience, even when working with large codebases or complex LLM interactions.

- **Responsive UI:** The extension is designed to keep the Visual Studio interface fast and responsive at all times. Intensive operations are offloaded to background threads, ensuring that the UI never blocks or stutters.
- **Streaming Token Processing:** LLM responses are streamed in real time. As tokens are generated by the model, they are processed and displayed incrementally, allowing you to see results immediately rather than waiting for the entire response.
- **Deferred Rendering:** To further enhance performance, BroPilot defers rendering of expensive operations such as syntax highlighting. This means that only the necessary parts of the interface are updated as new data arrives, minimizing unnecessary redraws and improving perceived speed.
- **Optimized for Large Projects:** Special care has been taken to ensure that BroPilot remains efficient and responsive, even in solutions with thousands of files or very large code documents.

These optimizations collectively ensure that BroPilot feels fast, fluid, and unobtrusive, letting you focus on your code without interruption.

## Key Features

### 1. **Local LLM Integration**
- Connects to local LLM servers (such as Ollama, LM Studio, or other compatible backends).
- No code or context is sent to the cloud—everything stays on your machine.

### 2. **Code Explanations**
- Select code and receive clear, concise explanations powered by your local model.
- Useful for onboarding, code reviews, and understanding legacy code.

### 3. **Refactoring Assistance**
- Get suggestions for improving code structure, readability, and maintainability.
- Supports common refactoring patterns and best practices.

### 4. **Seamless Visual Studio Integration**
- Native Visual Studio extension—no need to switch tools or editors.

### 5. **Configurable and Extensible**
- Easily configure the extension to connect to your preferred local LLM backend.

### 6. **Privacy and Security**
- All processing is performed locally; no data leaves your machine.
- Ideal for organizations with strict compliance or confidentiality requirements.

### 7. "Try" Button Feature

This feature enables users to apply code blocks directly within the current file in a sophisticated, embedded way. It leverages Visual Studio’s internal APIs for safe and context-aware code insertion.

Key Capabilities:
- Add class or method: Generate and insert new classes or methods into the current C# file.
- Replace class or method: Replace existing code with suggested implementations using intelligent generation.

Limitations:
- Language Support: Currently limited to C# files.
- Solution Context: The feature works only when the file is part of an active Visual Studio solution.

## Getting Started

1. **Install BroPilot**  
   Download and install the BroPilot extension from the Visual Studio Marketplace or build from source.

2. **Set Up a Local LLM Server**  
   Start your preferred local LLM backend (e.g., Ollama, LM Studio) and ensure it is accessible.

3. **Configure BroPilot**  
   In Visual Studio, open the BroPilot settings and specify the connection details for your local LLM server.

4. **Start Coding**  
   Use BroPilot features directly from the editor—trigger completions, request explanations, or refactor code with a click.
